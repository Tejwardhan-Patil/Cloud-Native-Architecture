# System Architecture Overview

## Overview

This cloud-native system is composed of multiple microservices, an API gateway, service mesh, and various infrastructure components following the principles of containerization, orchestration, and observability. The architecture ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource management.

## Microservices

Each microservice is self-contained, handling specific business logic, and follows the principles of domain-driven design. The services are deployed in containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes. Here's a breakdown:

- **Service A (Go-based)**: Handles [specific business function]. It exposes a REST API and communicates with Service B for [related operations].
- **Service B (Java-based)**: Performs [specific function]. This service is critical for [related domain] and uses [database name/type].

### API Gateway

The API Gateway acts as an entry point, handling request routing, composition, and response transformation. It is configured to route traffic between microservices and handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and rate limiting.

### Service Mesh

The system uses Istio as a service mesh to provide secure service-to-service communication, traffic management, and observability.

### Infrastructure

The infrastructure is provisioned using Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform and CloudFormation. The services run in containers managed by Kubernetes. Autoscaling and load balancing are enabled to handle varying workloads efficiently.

### Observability and Monitoring

Prometheus is used for system monitoring, while Grafana provides visual dashboards. Alerts are managed via Prometheus Alertmanager for operational visibility.
