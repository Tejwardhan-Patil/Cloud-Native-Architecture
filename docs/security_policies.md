# Security Policies

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

- All external API endpoints require authentication via API keys.
- Services use OAuth 2.0 for internal communication authorization.

## 2. Data Encryption

- All data in transit must be encrypted using TLS.
- Sensitive data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.

## 3. Secret Management

- Secrets are managed using a centralized secrets management tool.
- Access to secrets is restricted based on IAM roles.

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Kubernetes RBAC is implemented to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
- Each microservice is granted minimal permissions needed to function.

## 5. Auditing and Logging

- All access and actions on critical components are logged and monitored.
- Logs are stored for specific duration and are regularly audited.

## 6. Vulnerability Management

- Security scans are performed on Docker images during the CI/CD pipeline.
- Any identified vulnerabilities must be remediated before production deployment.

## 7. Incident Response

- An incident response plan is in place, which includes detection, containment, and recovery steps.
- Regular incident response drills are conducted to ensure readiness.
