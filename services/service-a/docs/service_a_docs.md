# Service A Documentation

## Overview

Service A is a cloud-native microservice built using Go and Python for auxiliary tasks. It operates within a Kubernetes-based deployment environment and is integrated with CI/CD pipelines for continuous delivery and management.

### Key Features

- **Language**: Go-based microservice with Python auxiliary scripts.
- **API**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for handling incoming HTTP requests.
- **Containerization**: Packaged in Docker containers.
- **Configuration**: Supports dynamic configuration via `config.yaml`.
- **Testing**: Includes unit and integration tests for robust validation.
- **Kubernetes**: Deployed in a Kubernetes cluster with service discovery, scaling, and orchestration.
  
## Architecture

### Components

1. **Go Service**:
    - The primary service is written in Go (`src/main.go`), handling the core business logic.
    - Request handlers are defined in `handlers.go`.

2. **Python Auxiliary Scripts**:
    - Python scripts located in `service_a.py` handle auxiliary tasks such as data pre-processing and other sidecar functionalities.

3. **Configuration Management**:
    - Configurations for the service are defined in `config/config.yaml`.

4. **Docker**:
    - The microservice is containerized using Docker, with its `Dockerfile` located in the root directory of the service.

5. **Kubernetes**:
    - The service is deployed on Kubernetes using the deployment spec in `deployment/k8s/deployment.yaml`.
    - Service exposure is managed via Kubernetes `service.yaml`.
